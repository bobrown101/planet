Planet Node
===========

This is the source code for Planet Node

To run this on your own machine*:

__1. Install Dependencies__
(assuming you've already installed Node.js)

    npm install


__2. Run the server__

    npm start

***An alternative to this command would be 'node main.js' , however they both accomplish the same thing.***

*Like falling off a log.

Enjoy!
